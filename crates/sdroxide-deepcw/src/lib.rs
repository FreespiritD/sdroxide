//! DeepCW — a neural CW decoder.
//!
//! A Rust port of [DeepCW](https://github.com/e04/deepcw-engine), carrying its
//! trained Conformer-CTC model. Where the classic decoder in `sdroxide-dsp`
//! measures an envelope and fits a timing model to it, this one reads an 800 Hz
//! slice of the spectrogram and predicts characters directly, which is why it
//! keeps copying several dB below where a timing fit falls apart, and why it
//! copies hand-sent CW whose timing no fit would accept.
//!
//! **This crate is AGPL-3.0-only**, unlike the rest of the workspace. Both the
//! model and the reference implementation it was ported from are AGPL, and §13
//! reaches anything that links it and is offered over a network.
//!
//! The shape of the thing is different from a streaming decoder and the callers
//! have to be built around that. The model consumes a *window* — several seconds
//! of audio at once — and returns the whole transcript for it. There is no
//! incremental "here are the characters that just completed". Two layers deal
//! with that:
//!
//! * [`Decoder`] is one window in, one transcript out. Everything else is built
//!   on it.
//! * [`Stream`] keeps a rolling buffer, re-decodes it as audio arrives, and
//!   splits the result into text that has stopped changing and a tail that has
//!   not. That is what a receive window wants.
//!
//! Inference costs roughly 25 ms for a 10 s window, so neither layer should be
//! driven from an audio callback. [`Worker`] and [`Pool`] move it onto threads.
