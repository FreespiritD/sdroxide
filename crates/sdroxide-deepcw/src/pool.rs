//! A small pool of decoders, for callers with many signals at once.
//!
//! The skimmer watches a whole band and may have a dozen stations going at the
//! same time. Each one needs its own window through the model, and at roughly
//! 25 ms apiece that is real work — enough to stall the skimmer's own thread if
//! it were done inline, and enough to be worth spreading across cores.
//!
//! Jobs are keyed so results can be matched back to whatever the caller is
//! tracking, and they come back in whatever order they finish. Submission never
//! blocks: when the pool is saturated the job is refused and the caller decides
//! what that means — for a skimmer it means this station waits for the next
//! round, which is exactly right.
