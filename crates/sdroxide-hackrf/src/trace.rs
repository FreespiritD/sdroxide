//! A self-contained session trace, so a user with a HackRF can produce a report
//! that a developer reading it later can act on.
//!
//! Everything here also goes to `tracing`, but `tracing` is the wrong shape for
//! a bug report: it needs `RUST_LOG` set *before* the run, and asking somebody
//! to reproduce a transmit fault with the right filter set is asking them to
//! key up twice. A [`Trace`] is always on, bounded, and dumps as one text block.
//!
//! # Why this matters more here than on the receivers next door
//!
//! On a receive-only backend a trace answers "what did the radio say". On this
//! one the question is almost always **"in what order did we say it"**. The
//! four SoapyHackRF defects this driver exists to avoid are every one of them
//! an ordering bug — an amplifier programmed before a mode change instead of
//! after, a receive stream deactivated instead of closed — and none of them is
//! visible in any single transfer. [`Trace::direction`] therefore marks each
//! transition with a banner, so the requests that bracket a key-down can be
//! read as a sequence rather than reconstructed from timestamps.
