//! Per-burst diagnostics, for characterising a band rather than decoding it.
//!
//! The device table the engine reports is the right answer for an operator and
//! the wrong one for finding out why nothing is being decoded. This is the other
//! view: every burst the gate opens on, with what was measured from it and
//! whether anything could read it — including the bursts nothing could.
//!
//! It exists because the honest answer to "does the decoder work on your band"
//! is a capture from that band, and because the first thing anyone will want to
//! know is what the *other* transmissions in the band are. A burst reported here
//! with a plausible symbol rate, a sane deviation and a handful of candidate
//! frames is a device worth writing a protocol module for; one with no candidates
//! at all is a modulation this chain does not handle.
//!
//! Unlike the engine's decoder this opens **every** channel in the plan whether
//! or not a protocol is implemented on it, because seeing that 868.95 MHz is busy
//! is exactly the point.
