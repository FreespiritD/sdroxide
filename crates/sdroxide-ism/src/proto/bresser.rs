//! Bresser Weather Center sensors on 868.3 MHz — the 5-in-1, 6-in-1 and 7-in-1
//! families and the water-leakage sensor, all behind one physical layer.
//!
//! # Source
//!
//! Layout transcribed from the protocol documentation comment in `rtl_433`'s
//! `src/devices/bresser_5in1.c`, which describes the device and publishes
//! seventeen captured frames — several annotated with the readings the sensor was
//! showing. Five of those are reproduced as test vectors below, and the ones with
//! stated readings (37.4 m/s gust, 27.5 m/s average, −7.0 °C, battery low)
//! reproduce exactly. That comment in turn credits
//! <https://github.com/andreafabrizi/BresserWeatherCenter>. No code was taken
//! from either.
//!
//! # Why this one is the safest frame in the band to accept
//!
//! Twenty-six payload bytes, of which the **first thirteen are the bitwise
//! complement of the last thirteen**. That is 104 bits of pure redundancy, on top
//! of a checksum byte holding the population count of the twelve data bytes. A
//! frame passing both is not a coincidence in any quantity of noise this band can
//! produce — which is worth having, because unlike the Fine Offset family there is
//! no CRC here at all.
//!
//! The complement is checked *loosely* — eleven of thirteen bytes rather than all
//! thirteen. One published capture differs in a single bit, and a single bit error
//! is exactly what a 13 dB burst produces; demanding all 104 bits agree would
//! throw away most real frames while the check remains overwhelming at eleven.
//!
//! # Frame
//!
//! ```text
//! byte  0 … 12   13   14   15    16  17    18  19    20  21   22   23 24   25
//!      ~13 … ~25 ck   id   s|typ gust dir|g wind w   temp t    hum  rain    B|t
//! ```
//!
//! Wind gust is plain binary in tenths of a metre per second, nine bits with the
//! top one in the low nibble of byte 17. Wind average and temperature are **BCD**,
//! two digits in one byte plus a hundreds digit in the low nibble of the next —
//! that structure is confirmed by the wind field, whose published 27.5 m/s only
//! comes out of the low nibble, and the temperature field follows it.
//!
//! Rainfall is deliberately not decoded: it is two BCD bytes whose digit order no
//! published capture states a value for, and a rain total is exactly the sort of
//! number that is useless if the digits are the wrong way round.
//!
//! # The 6-in-1 family
//!
//! A different frame behind the same preamble, sync word and symbol rate:
//! eighteen bytes carrying an LFSR-16 digest and an add-to-`0xff` checksum. Both
//! were verified against the four published captures annotated with readings, and
//! both reproduce exactly — which matters, because the add-checksum alone is eight
//! bits and would pass one noise frame in 256.
//!
//! ```text
//! byte 0 1   2 … 5   6      7 … 11   12 13    14   15 16   17
//!      digest  id    type   wind     temp  flags  hum  uv/rain  checksum
//! ```
//!
//! These sensors alternate message types: one carries temperature, humidity and
//! rain, the next carries only wind. The wind-only variant is a *different length*
//! and neither published check validates it at this one, so it is not decoded —
//! and, being rejected by the checks rather than misread, it costs nothing. Wind
//! from the temperature message is left alone too: its nibbles are interleaved and
//! partly inverted, and no capture annotated with a wind speed also validates
//! here, so there is nothing to check an implementation against.
//!
//! Byte 6 says which member of the family sent the frame — a weather station, a
//! thermo-hygro unit, a pool thermometer or a soil probe — and the last two
//! suppress the wind and UV fields rather than sending zeros.
//!
//! # The 7-in-1 family
//!
//! Twenty-five bytes behind the same sync word, whitened by XOR with `0xaa` and
//! checked by an LFSR-16 digest with a different key. Every field is BCD, and the
//! documentation for it is unusually good: seven captures are published with the
//! light level and UV index the sensor was showing, and all seven reproduce
//! exactly — see the tests. That is what makes this one safe to read fields from
//! rather than merely identify.
//!
//! It is also the **weakest frame in this module**, and worth knowing as such: a
//! sixteen-bit digest and nothing else, where the 5-in-1 carries around a hundred
//! bits of redundancy. One random frame in 65 536 passes it. Everything the format
//! offers on top of that is taken — the sensor-type nibble must be one that is
//! documented, every BCD field must be wholly decimal or wholly `0xf`, and a value
//! outside the range its sensor can produce fails the whole frame rather than
//! being dropped on its own — which together get it to roughly one in 200 000. A
//! device reported once is still worth treating as provisional; that is what the
//! heard-count in the panel is for.
//!
//! # The leakage sensor
//!
//! Eight bytes, and the only member of the family with a real CRC — CRC-16/XMODEM
//! over five of its bytes. Fifteen captures are published with the channel, alarm,
//! battery and startup state the sensor was in, and all fifteen validate.
//!
//! The flags byte is *outside* the CRC, which is worth knowing: the alarm bit
//! itself is unprotected. It is not unguarded, though — the same byte carries the
//! bit's own complement and a nibble that is always zero, so five bits of it are
//! checkable, and this module checks them.
