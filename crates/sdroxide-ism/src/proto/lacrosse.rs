//! LaCrosse "IT+" temperature and humidity sensors on 868.3 MHz — TX29-IT,
//! TX35, TX35DTH-IT, and the Conrad and TFA units that are the same radio in a
//! different case.
//!
//! # Source
//!
//! The frame layout below is transcribed from the protocol description and the
//! two worked examples in <https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/issues/477>,
//! which in turn credits <http://fredboboss.free.fr/articles/tx29.php>. Both
//! examples are reproduced as test vectors in this module, so the layout is
//! checked against captures with known readings rather than against a reading of
//! the prose.
//!
//! That description says the modulation is OOK. It is not — these sensors are
//! 2-FSK, which is why they are decoded here through a discriminator. The frame
//! layout is unaffected and the test vectors confirm it, but the discrepancy is
//! worth recording rather than quietly correcting.
//!
//! # Frame
//!
//! Eight bytes on the air, of which the first three are the preamble and sync
//! word the slicer has already consumed:
//!
//! ```text
//! byte    1     2  3      4        5        6        7      8
//!        0xaa  0x2d 0xd4  9iii  ii nu tttt  tttt tttt  w hhhhhhh  crc
//!              \_ sync _/  |    \__/  |  |  \_______ temperature, three BCD
//!                          |     |    |  |           digits, tenths of a
//!                          |     |    |  |           degree, offset by 40 °C
//!                          |     |    |  `_ unused
//!                          |     |    `____ new battery
//!                          |     `_________ device id, low 2 bits
//!                          `_______________ length nibble, always 9
//!                                            w = weak battery
//!                                            h = humidity, 7 bits, % RH
//! ```
//!
//! The CRC-8 covers bytes 4 to 7 and lands in byte 8.
//!
//! # Why this is hard to false-positive
//!
//! Four independent things have to agree before a frame is reported: the length
//! nibble is 9, the CRC matches, all three temperature digits are valid BCD, and
//! the temperature lands in a range a thermometer could survive. Noise that gets
//! past the sync word and preamble checks still has to clear all of those.
