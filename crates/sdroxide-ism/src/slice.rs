//! Bit recovery from a discriminator trace: symbol timing by brute force, then
//! a sync-word search that also settles which way round the tones are.
//!
//! # Why brute force
//!
//! A tracking loop — Gardner, early-late, anything with a bandwidth — has to
//! acquire, and a frame that is over in five milliseconds does not give it long
//! enough. `RifpRx` in `sdroxide-dsp` solves the same problem the same way and
//! its module note puts it best: on a burst that arrives without warning it costs
//! nothing to be right. Here that means slicing the burst at every one of
//! [`PHASES`] sub-symbol offsets and keeping whichever one finds the sync word
//! with the fewest bit errors. A few thousand comparisons per burst.
//!
//! # Why the tone sense is searched rather than declared
//!
//! Whether the higher of the two tones means one or zero depends on the device,
//! and then on whether anything in the receive chain mirrored the spectrum. A
//! known sync word settles it for free: look for the pattern *and* its
//! complement, and whichever matches tells you the sense for the rest of the
//! frame. Declaring it instead means a whole family of sensors silently fails to
//! decode on a front end with high-side injection.

/// timing than the crystal tolerance of these transmitters, so more would be
/// measuring nothing.
