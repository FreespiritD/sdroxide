//! WSPRnet: uploading what we decoded, and downloading who decoded us.
//!
//! Two halves of one conversation with <https://wsprnet.org>, and the reason
//! the mode exists at all — a WSPR receiver that keeps its spots to itself has
//! measured one end of a path and told nobody.
//!
//! **Upload** is one HTTP GET per spot against `/post`, the interface every
//! `wsprd`-based client uses. There is no batch form and no authentication: the
//! callsign in the query *is* the identity. When a slot decoded nothing there
//! is still something to say — `function=wsprstat` reports that this station
//! was listening and heard silence, which is how the network can tell a band
//! that was shut from a receiver that was off.
//!
//! **Download** is `/drupal/wsprnet/spots/json`, filtered by callsign. Two
//! questions are worth asking it: who heard *us* (`callsign=`), which is the
//! only way a transmit-only beacon learns anything at all, and what we
//! ourselves reported (`reporter=`), which reconciles our uploads against what
//! the network actually stored.
//!
//! Both run on their own threads over the blocking [`crate::http`] helpers, in
//! the shape [`crate::pskupload`] and [`crate::poll`] already use.
