//! A self-contained session trace, so a user with a Pluto can produce a report
//! that a developer without one can read.
//!
//! This backend was written without hardware to test against, which makes the
//! trace load-bearing rather than a nicety. Everything here also goes to
//! `tracing`, but `tracing` is the wrong shape for a bug report: it needs
//! `RUST_LOG` set before the run, and asking somebody to reproduce a connect
//! failure with the right filter set is asking them to reproduce it twice.
//! A [`Trace`] is always on, bounded, and dumps as one text block.
//!
//! # What it records
//!
//! Every IIOD command and its reply code, the context summary, the scan-element
//! formats the sample decoders were built from, a hex dump of the head of the
//! first `READBUF` response, and a periodic throughput summary. Buffer payloads
//! are *not* recorded — 2 Msps is 8 MB/s, and the framing is what diagnoses a
//! fault.
//!
//! The head of that first response is the single most valuable line in here:
//! the chunk framing (length line, then the channel mask, then the data) is the
//! part of the protocol most likely to be wrong in a from-scratch client, and
//! it cannot be checked from this side of the wire.
