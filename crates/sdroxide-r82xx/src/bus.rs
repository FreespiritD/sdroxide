//! The register bus the tuner sits on.
//!
//! # Why it is register-oriented rather than byte-oriented
//!
//! The obvious interface is "send these bytes to this address", and it bakes in
//! a limit belonging to one transport. The RTL2832U's I2C block carries at most
//! 8 bytes per transfer *including* the register index, so it chunks at 7
//! payload bytes; the FX3 carries the register in `wIndex` with 64 bytes of
//! payload beside it. Passing a byte blob would push the demodulator's limit
//! onto a bus that does not have it — and the tuner does not care either way,
//! because chunking is invisible to it.

/// nothing beside the USB round trip on the other side of it.
