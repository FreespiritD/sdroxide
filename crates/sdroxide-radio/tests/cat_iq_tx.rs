//! Transmitting on a rig that sends quadrature and takes audio back.
//!
//! A CAT rig on a sound card modulates the audio we put into it, whatever its
//! receive stream is carrying — so it has no I/Q transmitter, and its source
//! implements [`IqSource::tx_write_audio`] and not `tx_write`. Which of the
//! two the engine reaches for is `DeviceCaps::audio_mode || tx_audio`, and a
//! quadrature rig is not `audio_mode`: its stream is ordinary complex
//! baseband. So `tx_audio` is the only thing standing between such a rig and
//! the modulated-I/Q path, where the very first block would ask an
//! `IqSource` with no transmitter to write one and fail the over with "device
//! is not transmit capable" — which is exactly what a Kenwood in I/Q did.
