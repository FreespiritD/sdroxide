//! The radio's own PTT line — a foot switch, a mic button, or whatever is
//! wired to the board's PTT input. A source reports it through
//! [`ControlUpdate::Ptt`] and the engine must key on it exactly as it does on
//! the on-screen button.
//!
//! The second test is the reason the engine tracks who owns an over at all:
//! several boards report their PTT pin and their own MOX state on one line, so
//! an over we started comes straight back as "the operator is holding PTT". If
//! that were adopted, the release of a line we were never following would unkey
//! — or worse, its stale "closed" would hold the transmitter down after the
//! real owner let go.
