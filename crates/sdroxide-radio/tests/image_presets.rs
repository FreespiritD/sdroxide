//! The picture stores, driven through the real engine.
//!
//! What matters here is the command surface, because it is reachable from a
//! WebSocket that nothing authenticates: an upload has to be refused before it
//! costs anything, a file name has to be refused before it is joined to a
//! directory, and every request has to produce an answer so a gallery that is
//! waiting can stop. The store's own behaviour — scaling, fingerprinting,
//! ordering, path resolution — is covered by the unit tests in `image_store.rs`.
//!
//! Deliberately read-only against the operator's store: nothing here writes a
//! slot, so running the suite cannot disturb the pictures on the machine it is
//! run on.
