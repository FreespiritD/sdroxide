//! The engine owns `radio.json` and says what is in it.
//!
//! An SDR's own settings are not all gain stages: an RTL-SDR's AGC mode, its
//! ppm correction, its HF path and its bias tee have no `DeviceCaps` entry, and
//! the panel that drives them reads and writes this file. Where the radio is on
//! another machine that file is on *that* machine, so the engine is the only
//! thing in a position to read it, write it, and tell whoever is driving the
//! radio what it says. Everything a remote operator can do to an interface goes
//! through the two events asserted here.
//!
//! One test function on purpose: `SDROXIDE_CONFIG_DIR` is process-global, and
//! this one writes a real `radio.json` under it.
