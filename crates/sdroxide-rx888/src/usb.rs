//! USB layer: which receivers exist, getting one into its programmed state, and
//! how to reach its vendor commands.
//!
//! # Invariant: control I/O happens on the streaming thread, and only there
//!
//! [`UsbDev`] is deliberately not `Clone`, and the stream thread owns the only
//! one. nusb's `Interface` *is* `Send + Sync`, so poking the device from another
//! thread would compile. It would also interleave with the firmware's own I2C
//! transactions to the Si5351 and the tuner — the same hazard the RTL-SDR
//! backend documents. All control from outside arrives as `Ctrl` messages.
//!
//! # The two identities
//!
//! A receiver is either `04b4:00f3` (bare boot ROM, no radio behaviour) or
//! `04b4:00f1` (our firmware running). [`open`] hides the difference: it uploads
//! the image when it finds the former and returns the latter either way.
