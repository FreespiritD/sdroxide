//! The FT8 exchange, in words.
//!
//! An FT8 QSO is five messages of thirteen characters, and four of them look
//! almost identical: `OE3ABC K1ABC JN88`, `OE3ABC K1ABC -12`, `OE3ABC K1ABC
//! R-12`, `OE3ABC K1ABC RR73`. Reading the callsigns out and appending our own
//! signal report — which is what this used to do — says the same sentence five
//! times and never once says which stage of the contact it is. An operator
//! listening rather than watching hears a number repeat and cannot tell a
//! report from a sign-off.
//!
//! So the payload is classified and *that* is what gets read: "reports minus
//! twelve", "confirms minus twelve", "rogers and seventy three". The stage is
//! the information; the callsign only has to be said because more than one
//! station may be calling.
//!
//! # Where the numbers go
//!
//! A message that carries a report says that report and nothing else — the
//! report they sent is the one that matters, and appending our own measurement
//! of them puts two different numbers in one breath. Our measurement rides on
//! the messages that carry no number of their own: the call and the CQ, where
//! it is what decides whether the contact is worth having.
//!
//! # Why the classifier is duplicated
//!
//! `sdroxide-digi` has one of these, and it is the sequencer's. This crate does
//! not depend on that one — sdroxide-digi is GPL-3.0-or-later and this crate is
//! linked into every build — so the twenty lines are written again here rather
//! than dragging the licence across the whole tree. They are a wire format that
//! has not changed since 2017; if they ever diverge it is because the sequencer
//! grew a case, and the worst outcome is a message read as free text.
