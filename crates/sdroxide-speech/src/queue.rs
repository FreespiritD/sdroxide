//! What to say next.
//!
//! A radio produces changes far faster than anyone can be told about them. Spin
//! the dial and thirty state snapshots a second arrive; work a pileup and a
//! hundred decodes a minute do. The queue is what turns that into speech an
//! operator can actually follow, on three ideas:
//!
//! - **Coalescing.** An announcement with a [`Key`] replaces a pending one with
//!   the same key rather than queueing behind it. The tenth frequency
//!   read-out while scrolling overwrites the ninth; it does not wait for it.
//! - **A budget.** Both the item count and the *estimated speaking time* are
//!   capped. Twenty seconds is where an announcement stops describing the radio
//!   and starts describing the past.
//! - **A gag.** While the transmitter is keyed, everything below an alert is
//!   refused outright rather than deferred — a queue that unloads five seconds
//!   of stale announcements the moment you unkey is its own bug.
//!
//! No clock of its own: `now` is passed in, as egui's monotonic frame time.
