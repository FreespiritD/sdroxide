//! The TCI **server**: sdroxide acting as a TCI rig so third-party clients
//! (WSJT-X's TCI rig type, JTDX, MSHV, skimmer tools) can drive it.
//!
//! Shape mirrors `SkimmerController`: the DSP engine owns a
//! [`TciServerController`], pushes realtime IQ and RX audio into it over bounded
//! channels (dropping on backpressure so a slow client can never stall the
//! engine), and drains [`ServerRequest`]s non-blocking each tick. All socket
//! work happens on a hub thread plus one thread per client.
//!
//! **Model.** sdroxide has a single tunable VFO pair, so the server advertises
//! one transceiver (`trx_count:1`) with two channels (`channels_count:2`,
//! A and B). Streams — wideband IQ, RX audio, TX audio — exist on receiver 0
//! only. `dds:` is our hardware centre frequency and `if:` the VFO's offset
//! from it, matching how sdroxide's own TCI client drives a rig.
//!
//! **Multiple clients** all see the same radio: last writer wins, and every
//! client receives the resulting status broadcast (including the one that
//! caused it — real TCI servers echo unconditionally). Only one client at a
//! time may hold the transmit key.
//!
//! **Every command must be echoed back, even when it changes nothing.** Clients
//! use the echo as the acknowledgement and block on it: WSJT-X sends
//! `audio_start:0;`, waits, and aborts the whole connection with "TCI Audio
//! could not be switched on" if the echo never arrives. Suppressing no-op
//! echoes as redundant is therefore a connection-breaking bug, not an
//! optimisation. The state diff in [`text::diff_lines`] is only for *unsolicited*
//! changes (the operator moved the dial); acknowledgements come from the hub.
//!
//! To debug a client that won't talk to us, `RUST_LOG=sdroxide_tci=debug` logs
//! the whole conversation in both directions.
