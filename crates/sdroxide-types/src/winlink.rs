//! Winlink radio-email vocabulary: the mailbox as the UI sees it, and the
//! account settings a session needs.
//!
//! The protocol itself lives in `sdroxide-winlink`, which is native-only. What
//! is here is only the shape of a mailbox and a session's status, because both
//! have to cross the wire to a browser client that links none of that code.
//!
//! The mailbox lives on the machine with the radio and is read **lazily**: a
//! listing carries metadata, and the body and attachments are fetched one
//! message at a time. That is the same arrangement the picture store uses, and
//! for the same reason — a mailbox with attachments in it is far too big to
//! mirror into every client on connect.
