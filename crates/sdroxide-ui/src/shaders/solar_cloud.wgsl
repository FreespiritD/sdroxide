// The cloud deck, as a stack of slices through the troposphere.
//
// Weather is a depth of air, not a picture stuck on a sphere, and the argument
// here is the one `solar_aurora.wgsl` makes one atmosphere higher up: hand the
// shader concentric spheres at real altitudes and let each contribute its own
// slice. What is different is that cloud *occludes*. The aurora emits zero
// alpha and only ever adds light; a deck hides the coastline under it, so these
// slices composite, and the CPU hands them over bottom-up so the blend runs
// back to front.
//
// Nothing about the vertical structure is invented. `cloud_tex` carries, per
// column, how thick the cloud is and how *high its top stands* — the second
// straight out of the infrared mosaic, because a cloud top's temperature is its
// altitude. So a thunderhead towers over the stratus beside it for the same
// reason it does in the sky, and a shell only contributes where it is inside
// the cloud that column actually has.
//
// The lightning is the one invention, and it is confined to the timing. Where
// the storms are, how large, how tall and how often each flashes all come from
// the same mosaic; which millisecond a given stroke fires does not, because no
// free worldwide feed of real strikes exists. The flashes light the cloud from
// inside rather than being drawn as marks on it, which is why an anvil goes
// bright from below.
